<h2>Here is some basic information to help you around the station!</h2>
<p>Webster Dictionary describes a locomotive as "a self-propelled vehicle that runs on rails and is used for moving railroad cars". Locomotives are very important for day to day life weather you notice it or not. Locomotives main perpose is to transport large amounts of goods or people. This could be a freight train blocking the road making you late for work or the subway train you missed also making you late for work. No matter how you look at it, locomotives are a staple in today's society. Before the invention of locomotives, many people had to travel on foot or horse back. This mode of transportaion was slow and tiring, but locomotives made it unfathomablly quicker. To put this into perspective, people walk at a speed around 2.5 - 4 miles per hour, meanwhile, the earliest locomotives were as fast as 15 miles per hour.

 People could travel over 3 times faster and not have to worry about sore feet! Now they go much faster, with bullet trains getting up to 200mph! Multiple kinds of trains have been made throughout the years since it's creation in 1804. Now many of these mechanical titans rush through cities, mountains, plains, forest, etc. </p>
